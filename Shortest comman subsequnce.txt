Shortest comman subsequnce :

problem :

given two strings we need to find the length of the sortest string that have both the strings as a sub sequence

solution:

this problem is just a permutation of the longest comman subsequence,
here we find the longest comman subsequecne and then retuen the value of (size of s1+size of s2-longestcommansubseq)
