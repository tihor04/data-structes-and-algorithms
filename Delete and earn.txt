Delete and earn: 

problem: 

we are  given an array, numbers and we need to find the max that we can take out of it, given the condition.
if we choose to delete a number nums[i] for it then we are not allowed to choose the numbers nums[i]+1 or nums[i]-1.

solution :

 Brute force approach
 to this problem can be use recursion and using two of the possible cases, either we incudle the present
 number to our answer or we don't.

Dynamic progrmaing approach: 
we keep a hash map with number of occourances of each element in the nums array, and we have another array to keep the unique elements of the given array

we make a dp array of the same size of the array we made,and we are only concered about the last two indices of the present element.

-> we will have two cases if(the prev element is 1 less than present)->p2=max(currval+p1,p2)		

											else->p2=currval+e2 
											->we shift the value of e1 accordingly  and at last we return e1;
