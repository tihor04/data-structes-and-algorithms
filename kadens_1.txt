Kadane's A;go question 1:
problem->

(kanden's alogrithm is basically used to find the sum of subarrats)
we need to make an array to find the max sum that can be achived with the ith index as the ending point.

solution: we make a dp array in which we entertain two cases 1)we add the present element to our prev sum
                                                             2)we only concider the present element and ignore the prev sum
we take the max of these two cases.
