maximum points that can be obtained form cards

problem: 

given an array we need to find out the maximum output that we can take out from a given array when we are only allowed to take one number from only the sides only k times.

solution: 


->this question canot be solved by simply using the maximum number form both the sides and simply returing the result

->a naive solution to this problem can be through recursion but the time complexity would be 2^n

->a better appoach will be using the sliding window technique.
 	
	-> we first store the sum of our present array in a variable sum.  
	-> the basic idea for this algo is that instead of choosing the numbers that we want we can choose the numbers that we dont want.
	-> we make two pointers one at k and other at end of the array, (as the numbers from 0 to k-1 will be the numbers that we will choose) 
	->we move this pointer array towards the left end of the array can contineously monitor the sum of the left over elements
	->at last we return the maximum form the left over elements.
