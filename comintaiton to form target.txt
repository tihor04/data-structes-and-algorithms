comintaiton to form target:

problem -

we are given an array and a target, we need to find out number of combinations that will give us the target ans the answer, repeation of element allowed.

solution-

to solve this preblem we will use recursion .

we gloabbaly declare a 2d vector ans

we make a function solve which takes -array,target,index,empty vector as input

now we will have two choices for a perticular index -1 to include it in our answer -here we do not increment the index as we can again use the current element in our ans	
								    -2 to not include it in our answer here we increment our index

when we use the element at index at i we push it in the vector and after calling our solve funtion we pop it out(backtracking)
