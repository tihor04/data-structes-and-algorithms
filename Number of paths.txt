Number of paths:

problem->
we are given a aXb matrix and we are at the 0,0 index, we need to find the number of paths to reach a-1,b-1 index;

solution: 

the recursive approach to this question will be the following:

base cases:
1) if we reach the index 0,0 we return 1
2) if move to an index where i<0 or j<0 we return 0

or else we retrun the sum of the two calls -> (i-1,j) +(i,j-1)

to make a more optimised solution of the problem we make a 2d dp matrix of size a,b;
and fill it according to the recuresive calls.
