lexicographcally next permutation (NON_THINKABLE)

problem: given an array find the lexicographically next permutation of the array:

solution : 

this is more of a trick than a solution.

1)find the largest index k such that nums[k]<nums[k+1] (if there is no such index then simply reverse the array and return)
2) find the largest element l>k such that nums[k]<nums[l]
3) swap the numberers at k and l
4) reverse the subarray from k+1 to n;
