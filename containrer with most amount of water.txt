containrer with most amount of water :

problem: given an array we need to find the index iand j (j>i) such that max amount of water gets collected, amount of water collected between index i and j is, min(arr[i],arr[j])*(j-i);

solution:

using two pointer approach,

->make a max sum variable and, make two pointers i and j 
->store the amount of water that can be stored 
->if the number at i is greater than that of  j then move j else move i
