possible jumps:

problem: we are given an array, each element of the array tells us the maximum jumps that we can make from a perticular index. find if we can reach the end of the array or not.

solution 

DP sol->O(n^2)

greedy solution-O(n)-> we maintain a variable that stores the maximum dist we can cover til that perticualr index, and if this variable becomes less than our iterator i at any point then we
				simply return false;
