the pair with diff as k :

problem :  given an array, and a number k, we need to find the pairs with difference as k 

solution :

basic idea-> we store the diffrence between consicutive numbers of the sorted array 
	    -> then sum of the diffrences between i'th and j'th number will be the diffrece between the i'th and j'th number 

sol;
->sort the array and solve for the case when k=0 separately.
-> now store the non zero values of difference of consicutive numbers .
->apply the algo for subarray with given sum .

return  the number of subarrays with given sum
