find the number of subarrays with a given sum;

problem: given an array and a number k , find the  number of subarrys with the sum k;

sol:

NOTE: do not use recursion to solve this problem as we will have repeating test cases, recursion will be important in the case when we need to find subsequences.

-make a sum variable and a hashtabe.

-traverse through the array. 

-now keep adding the numbers in the array and check the following conditions:-if the sum becomes equals to k then increase the count.
												     -if the sum already exist in the map then increase the count 

-push the present sum to the map

-return the count;
