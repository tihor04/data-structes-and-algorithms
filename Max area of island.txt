Max area of island : 

problem : 

we are given a 2d array , with all zeros and 1's , we need find out the max area formed by a patch of one's (concidering only the for directions)

solution: 

-> here we use a visited array to not visit the visited node again.

-> we traverse through the give 2d array , and if we encounter 1 one that is not visited
then we traverse through the 4 directions and we have a separate funtion to recuresivly traverse
throught the selected 1's and we return 0 if we get an invalid index or a visited index or a 
0 else we return 1+ (the recursive call for all other 4 directions).
