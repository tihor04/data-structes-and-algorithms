1) count ways to reach nth stair:(we can only climb 1 or 2 stair at a time, order matters)

steps:

->basically its answer is the fibonacchi sequence as in the recursive solution we will call the fucntion once for 
 n-2(taking two stairs at a time)  and n-1 (taking one stair at a time) which in turn will provide us with our fibanacchi serise.

=======================

2) count the ways to reach nth stair (when order dosnt matters and we can only move 1 or 2 steps at a time)

steps:

->this can be solved using the solutiion of the coin select problem the only difference is that we only have coins of denomination 1 and 2
