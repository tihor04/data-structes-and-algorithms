Longerst comman subsequence:
 
problem->

given two strings we need to find the longest subsequece with the comman characters

solution ->

 the recuresive approach of this question will be the following:

 we start form the end of the two strings and if the find the same character at the index then we return 1+recusive_call_for(i-1,j-1) else we return the max 0f(when we move -1 in s1,that in
s2)


using the above recursive idea we form a 2d array to get the optimised solution.
