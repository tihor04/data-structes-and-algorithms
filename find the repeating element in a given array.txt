find the repeating element in a given array;

problem : 
 we are given an array of size n+1 and it contains elements of [1,n] inclusive, the array has only one element that repeats.
 we need to find the repeating element and we are not allowed to change the array or to use any extra space


solution :

1) if we are alloed to change the array we can easily sort the array and find the only repeating element

2) if we are allowed to use extra space then we will use an unordered set to the values already found in the array.

3) now , we are not allowed to use any of them , therefore we will use binary search 

   
  	->low=1,high=size-1
	->while low<=high
	->find mid ;
	->count the number of elements that are smaller than or equal to mid 
	->if the count is less than or eqaul to mid we move the lower pointer 
	->else we move the high pointer 
	->return low


Explaination of the appoach : 

suppose that the element k repeats itself so the arrya will look like [1,2,......k-1,k,k,k+1.....n]
and if the element is between 1 and mid then count of elements lower than mid will be greater than mid so we move towards the right of the array 
similar is the case for elememt being at the right of array.
