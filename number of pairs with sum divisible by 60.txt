number of pairs with sum divisible by 60;

problem: 

given an array we need to find two indexes such that, the sum of numbers at i and j is divisbile by 60;

solution: 

PS: this solution is applicable to not only 60 but also any other numbers ;

-> we make an array of remainders of size 60
->run a loop through the array and store the remiander of the currelement to the array(add the element to the rem array at last to remove extra cases when curr =30)
->if the rem is zero then add rem[0] to the ans 
->if the rem is non zero  the add rem[60-curr] to the result;
