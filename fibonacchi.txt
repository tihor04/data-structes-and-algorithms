fibbonacchi using DP

tabulation approach->
  1) make an n+1 arr and intialise the 0th and the 1st index to 0 and 1 resp.
  2) now run a loop from 2nd index and fill the array as arr[i]=arr[i-1]+arr[i-2]
  3) return arr[n]



memoisation approach->
1) create an array of size n+1 with all values as -1
2) now do a recuresive traversal but also have a if codition that when only the arr[n]==-1 then we recuresivly 
   call for n-1 and n-2 and if arr[n] already exist then we simply return arr[n]
