Stock Buy and selling problem:

problem: we are given an array of prices of stock and we need to choose two days, one when we will buy a stock and the other
when we will sell a stock.

solution:

if the problem asked us to find the overall profit throughout the period then we would use kadane's algorithm
but here we will :

 			->have two variables first maxpro=0 and ind=0;
			->we run a loop form 1 to n and check of the curr element is bigger than our element at ind we store the
			 max of the differece in the present two indices and the maxpro;
			->and if the curr element is smaller than the ind element we move the ind pointer to i
			 then we return maxpro
