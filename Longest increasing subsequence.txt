Longest increasing subsequence
problem-> given an array find the longest increacing subsequence 

solution
we make a dp array of size n in whihc we store the max lenth of a subsequence that will end at that index, to do this
we travere through the array and and for every index i we traverse to all the elements behind it and if an element is smaller than 
the present element then if the current value of dp[i] is grater or the dp[j]+1 is greater.
