Sum of all substring of a number: 

problem-> find the sum of all possible substrings of a string:

approch 1(n^2)

we make a 2d dp matrix that is (sizeofstring)X(sizeofstring)do which will signify start of index and end index of the sub string
here we make the lower matrix triangle as our intrseted part, the sum of all these elements is our answer.

approach 2

for every index we make substrings that end with the present char and we add them all.

approach 3:

dp[i]=(i+1)*num[i]+10*dp[i-1]
the sum of every element of the dp array will be the answer
