problem->
we are given an array and we need to find the max sum of non adjecent elements

solution->
case 1: when all the elements of the array are negative-> fir this we run a loop and find the max element and then return it.
case 2:when there are both positive and negative elements in the array-> we make a dp array in which the dp[0] will be max
                                                                          max of 0 and arr[0] and dp[1] will be max of 
                                                                         dp[0] and arr[1]. and we run a loop and use the logic
                                                                         dp[i]=max(dp[i-1],arr[i]+dp[i-2]); 
                                                                           return dp[n-1];
