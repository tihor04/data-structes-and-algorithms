Maxnimum cut segment:

problem->

we are given a rope of length n and we are given three numbers x,y,z. we can only make cuts of length x,y,z. we need to find the max sections that can be made.

solution-> 

we make a dp array of size n+1, and we initialize the 0th index with 0 and rest other with INT_MIN

then we traverse through the array and for every index we check if the lenght i is grater than x,y,z(do seprate checks for all three)

and if the value of dp[i-(x,y,z)] is not INT_MIN we find the maximum value of(dp[i], dp[i-(x,y,z)];
