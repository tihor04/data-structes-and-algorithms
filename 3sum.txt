3sum problem: 

given an array find the three numbers such that the sum of all the three numbers is 0,(the set of numbers in the answer should not repeat themselves)

solution:
 -first of all we need to sort the array so that we can apply the two pointer approach later on 
 -then we run a for loop form 0 to the size of the array to fix the first number of the triplet 
 -as the first number is already fixd then we run a while loop for the two pointer approach that we need to apply. note that the number we need to find now will be negative of the fixed  
 number.
 -when the desired number is found-1)push the number to the answer vector.
					     2)to remove dumplicates while(st<end&&arr[st]==arr[st+1])st++;(this will skip all the repeating elements for the variable st)
					     3)do the same with end i.e. while(st<end && arr[end]==arr[end-1])end--;
					     4)now do the same for the varialbe that we originally fixed i.e i -while(i+1<n && arr[i]==arr[i+1])i++;

then return the ans vector;
