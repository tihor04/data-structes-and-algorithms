Find the Repeating numbers in O(n) and O(1)

problem: 

we are given an array of size n and it contains intergers form 1 to n, each element of the array either is present one's or twice we need to find the element that are present twice.

solution :

super naive soultion -> O(N^2) and O(1):
 						 run two loops and find the numbers 
naive solution -> sort the array or use maps

efficient solution->
			 ->we make the visited number index -ve i.e. let arr[0]=4 so we make arr[4-1] -ve,  so whenever we get a number arr[i] that is 4 then arr[4-1] will already be -ve and we 
			  will be certian that the present number is repeated.
