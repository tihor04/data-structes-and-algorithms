Merge two arrays of size m and n in O(m+n):

problem:

given two arrays one of size m+n (with m numbers and n zeros) and other of size n ;

solution-> 
make 3 pointers 1-end of array 1 , 2-end of array two , 3- end of the m+n array

while pointer 1 and 2 are greater than zero 
we check for the greater element of the two arrays and replace it with the third pointer.

at last we double check if there is any element left in the second array by running another while loop

time complexity - O(n)
space O(1)
